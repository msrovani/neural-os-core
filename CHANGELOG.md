## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added

- VGA text mode output via `map_physical_memory` feature (`vga_buffer.rs`)
  - `Writer` with scrolling, 16-color support, `core::fmt::Write` impl
  - Macros `print!` / `println!` for kernel-wide use
  - Buffer mapped at runtime using `physical_memory_offset` from `BootInfo`
- Serial port logging via `uart_16550` crate (`serial.rs`)
  - 16550 UART initialization at port `0x3F8`
  - `lazy_static!` + `spin::Mutex` for safe global access
  - Macros `serial_print!` / `serial_println!`
- Dual-output panic handler in `main.rs`
  - `panic!()` writes to both VGA and serial simultaneously
- New crate dependencies: `spin` v0.9, `lazy_static` v1.5, `uart_16550` v0.2
- `bootloader` as regular dependency (kernel-side `BootInfo` type with `map_physical_memory`)
- ADR-0002: VGA and Serial Logging Infrastructure

### Changed

- Entry point migrated from raw `extern "C" fn _start()` to `bootloader::entry_point!(kernel_main)`
- VGA base address computed as `0xB8000 + physical_memory_offset` (runtime, not hardcoded)
- `STATE.md` updated with Sprint 2 progress

### Added

- Initial bare-metal Rust kernel scaffold
  - `#![no_std]` + `#![no_main]` environment
  - Minimal panic handler (infinite loop)
  - Serial init and output via raw port I/O
- Bootloader integration (`bootloader` v0.9.34 build-dep)
  - `bootimage runner` for automated QEMU launch
  - `relocation-model=static` to produce `ET_EXEC` ELF (fixes bootloader compatibility)
- Toolchain configuration
  - `rust-toolchain.toml` pinned to nightly
  - `.cargo/config.toml` with target and runner
- Documentation protocol
  - ADR-0001: Initial Architecture and Toolchain
  - State tracker (`STATE.md`)
  - Session log (`SESSION_001.md`)
- MSYS2 + MinGW-w64 setup for Windows toolchain without MSVC
- `AGENTS.md` — system rules for AI-assisted IDEs
